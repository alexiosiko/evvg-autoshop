		description: "I came into town on the 22nd of Dec for the holidays and my truck left me stranded. After towing it 3 times, it eventually ended up with George at Evvg auto. I believe I spoke to him on the 26th or 27th and after a bit of a delay he was able to get working on my truck and had it done by the 30th so I could get home n get on with my move out of town. He saved me! Great shop, high quality work and George went above and beyond to help me out",
